"Pig Game"   
Description:-  
The Pig Game is a two-player dice game where the players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die. The objective is to reach a certain score, typically 100 points, before your opponent. The game involves risk-taking and decision-making as players decide whether to roll the dice and accumulate points or pass the turn to avoid losing their current round's points.
  
Features:-  
Two-player gameplay with alternating turns.
Rolling a 1 on the die ends the current player's turn, forfeiting their accumulated points for that round.
Players can choose to "Hold" to add their round points to their total score and pass the turn to the opponent.
The first player to reach or exceed a set score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
Simple and intuitive user interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.
